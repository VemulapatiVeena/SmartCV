# SmartCV📝
SmartCV is a powerful AI-based resume screening tool that helps job seekers optimize their resumes based on the specific role they're applying for. By using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, SmartCV offers instant insights into how well your resume aligns with a job description, mimicking how recruiters and ATS systems evaluate candidates.


## 🔍How It Works
1. 📤 Upload Resume (PDF)
The user uploads a resume file. The system extracts the content using a reliable PDF parser for further processing.

2. 📝 Paste Job Description
Enter or paste the job description (JD) of the role you're targeting. This acts as the benchmark for resume comparison.

3. 📊 AI-Based Similarity Score
Using a Sentence-BERT model, SmartCV compares the resume and JD to calculate a similarity percentage — reflecting keyword overlap, context relevance, and ATS compatibility.

4. 🧾 AI Feedback Summary
Powered by Groq’s LLaMA-based LLM, the app provides a breakdown of strengths and gaps:

✅ Well-matched sections

⚠️ Areas to improve

❌ Missing or irrelevant parts

Each category gets scored (1 to 5) for clarity.

5. 📥 Downloadable Report
The user receives a downloadable analysis report with suggestions, making resume editing easier and more strategic.
